# simplegui
Clone of simplegui module from Rice university

This project is a stub at the moment. It serves some static html/css/javacript
files to a wsgi server. At the moment a simple game is served.

The basic idea of this project is to create a wsgi interface of the simplegui module.
Instead running python in the browser written in javascript this aims on running
python natively on a server an use the wsgi interface for graphical output.

This project will cover most of what I have learned in html/css/javascript/python.
